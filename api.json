      "full": "The **pocong** (also known as **hantu pocong**, or \\\"shroud ghost\\\") is one of the most iconic and widely recognized supernatural entities in Indonesian folklore. This distinctive ghost appears bound in a white burial shroud (*kain kafan*), unable to walk and thus forced to hop or jump in its movements. The pocong represents the soul of a deceased person whose burial shroud was not properly untied after the required waiting period following Islamic burial rites. Unlike vengeful spirits that seek to harm the living, the pocong is typically portrayed as a trapped, suffering soul desperately seeking release from its cloth prison. This makes the pocong unique among Indonesian supernatural beings—it evokes both fear and pity, terror and sympathy. The belief in pocong reflects deep-rooted Islamic funeral customs merged with indigenous Indonesian beliefs about the proper treatment of the dead. The pocong phenomenon is deeply embedded in Indonesian Muslim communities, where proper burial rites are considered essential for the peaceful transition of the soul to the afterlife. The fear of becoming—or encountering—a pocong serves as a cultural enforcement mechanism, ensuring that funeral traditions are meticulously observed and that the deceased receive proper respect and care."
