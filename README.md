## Overview

The **pocong** (also known as **hantu pocong**, or "shroud ghost") is one of the most iconic and widely recognized supernatural entities in Indonesian folklore. This distinctive ghost appears bound in a white burial shroud (*kain kafan*), unable to walk and thus forced to hop or jump in its movements. The pocong represents the soul of a deceased person whose burial shroud was not properly untied after the required waiting period following Islamic burial rites.

Unlike vengeful spirits that seek to harm the living, the pocong is typically portrayed as a trapped, suffering soul desperately seeking release from its cloth prison. This makes the pocong unique among Indonesian supernatural beings—it evokes both fear and pity, terror and sympathy. The belief in pocong reflects deep-rooted Islamic funeral customs merged with indigenous Indonesian beliefs about the proper treatment of the dead.

The pocong phenomenon is deeply embedded in Indonesian Muslim communities, where proper burial rites are considered essential for the peaceful transition of the soul to the afterlife. The fear of becoming—or encountering—a pocong serves as a cultural enforcement mechanism, ensuring that funeral traditions are meticulously observed and that the deceased receive proper respect and care.

## Etymology and Names

- **Pocong** (Indonesian): The most common term, derived from the wrapped or bound appearance of the shroud
- **Hantu Pocong**: Literally "pocong ghost" or "shroud ghost"

- **Hantu Kain**: "Cloth ghost" (some areas of Sumatra)
- **Hantu Bungkusan**: Another variation meaning "packaged ghost"
- **Pocong Gentayangan**: "Wandering pocong," specifically referring to pocong that roam at night

- **Lepas Pocong**: The ritual of loosening the shroud ties

## Historical and Cultural Context

### Islamic Funeral Traditions in Indonesia

The pocong belief is intrinsically linked to Islamic burial practices that arrived in the Indonesian archipelago between the 13th and 16th centuries. Islam gradually spread throughout the region, particularly in Java, Sumatra, and coastal trading cities, bringing with it specific funeral rites that differed significantly from earlier Hindu-Buddhist and animistic practices.

In Islamic tradition, the deceased must be buried as soon as possible after death, typically within 24 hours. The body is ritually washed (*mandikan mayat*), wrapped in a white cotton shroud (the *kain kafan*), and buried without a coffin, lying on its right side facing Mecca. The shroud is tied at the head, torso, and feet to secure it during the burial process.

### The 40-Day Tradition

Central to pocong beliefs is the tradition of *lepas pocong*—the untying of the shroud bindings. According to Indonesian Islamic custom blended with local beliefs, the soul of the deceased remains in a transitional state for 40 days after death. During this period, the soul is believed to linger near the grave and the places familiar to it in life.

On the 40th day after burial (sometimes the 7th day in certain regions), family members are supposed to return to the grave to symbolically or literally untie the shroud knots. This ritual liberates the soul, allowing it to fully depart from the earthly realm and continue its journey in the afterlife. If this ritual is neglected—whether through forgetfulness, family discord, or lack of proper knowledge—the soul remains bound to the earth, trapped within the confines of its burial shroud, becoming a pocong.

### Syncretic Beliefs

The pocong tradition exemplifies the syncretic nature of Indonesian Islam, where Islamic practices merged with pre-existing animistic and Hindu-Buddhist beliefs. The concept that improper funeral rites can trap a spirit reflects indigenous Indonesian beliefs about the spiritual world and the importance of ritual correctness, adapted to an Islamic framework.

Pre-Islamic Indonesian societies held elaborate beliefs about death, the afterlife, and the proper treatment of the deceased. The pocong can be seen as a continuation of these concerns, translated into an Islamic idiom. This synthesis allowed traditional Indonesian spiritual anxieties to persist even as the population converted to Islam.

## Physical Description

The pocong presents one of the most distinctive and immediately recognizable appearances in supernatural folklore:

### Basic Appearance
- **Shroud-bound form**: Completely enveloped in a white burial shroud (*kain kafan*)
- **Head covering**: The shroud covers the entire head, typically tied above the head, creating a pointed or conical shape
- **Face**: Usually described as pale, greenish, or deathly white when visible through the shroud
- **Facial expression**: Often portrayed with a grim, suffering expression, hollow eyes, or completely blank features
- **Height**: Human-sized, corresponding to the height of the deceased in life

### Movement
- **Hopping locomotion**: Unable to walk due to the shroud binding the legs together, the pocong moves by jumping or hopping
- **Upright stance**: Maintains a stiff, vertical posture while moving
- **Jumping height**: Described as capable of surprisingly high or long leaps, sometimes clearing considerable distances
- **Speed**: Despite the awkward movement, pocong are often described as moving with unsettling speed

### Shroud Details
- **Color**: Pure white, though descriptions sometimes include staining, dirt, or decay
- **Knots**: Three main ties—at the head (above the crown), around the chest/torso, and at the feet
- **Condition**: May appear fresh and clean or deteriorated and stained, depending on how long the spirit has been wandering
- **Transparency**: Some accounts describe the pocong as semi-transparent or ghostly

### Sensory Characteristics
- **Smell**: Often accompanied by the smell of incense, flowers from the funeral, or decay
- **Sound**: The rustling of fabric, soft moaning or crying, or complete silence
- **Temperature**: Cold spots or a sudden drop in temperature when a pocong is near
- **Visual effects**: Described as luminous or glowing in the dark, particularly around cemeteries

### Variations
- **Pocong Genderuwo**: Occasionally confused with genderuwo, but maintains the shroud-bound form
- **Bloody Pocong**: In cases of violent death, the shroud may show bloodstains
- **Decomposing Pocong**: Older pocong may show signs of decay, with the shroud deteriorating

## Origins and Creation

### How a Pocong Comes to Be

The creation of a pocong follows a specific pattern rooted in funeral ritual failure:

1. **Death and Burial**: A person dies and is buried according to Islamic tradition, wrapped in the *kain kafan* with the three traditional knots

2. **The Waiting Period**: The soul enters the transitional period, traditionally 40 days (or 7 days in some regions), during which it remains attached to the earthly realm

3. **The Neglected Ritual**: The family fails to perform the *lepas pocong* ritual—untying the shroud knots on the designated day

4. **Spiritual Imprisonment**: The soul, unable to free itself from the physical binding of the shroud, remains trapped between worlds

5. **Transformation**: The bound soul rises from the grave, becoming a pocong that wanders in search of release

### Factors Leading to Pocong Creation

Several circumstances can result in the creation of a pocong:

- **Ignorance**: Family members unaware of the traditional requirement to untie the shroud
- **Neglect**: Deliberate or accidental failure to return to the grave on the specified day
- **Family Absence**: No living relatives to perform the ritual
- **Improper Burial**: Hasty or incorrect burial procedures
- **Forgotten Graves**: Graves that are abandoned or forgotten over time
- **Disturbed Graves**: Cemeteries that are damaged, relocated, or desecrated
- **Unresolved Affairs**: The deceased had important unfinished business or died with regrets
- **Family Disputes**: Discord among family members preventing proper ritual observance
- **Poor Burial Locations**: Graves in inauspicious or spiritually troubled places

### Special Cases

Certain circumstances create particularly troubled or powerful pocong:

- **Violent Death**: Those who died suddenly or violently may become especially restless pocong
- **Suicide**: Particularly tragic, as Islamic tradition complicates their spiritual status
- **Unmarried Youth**: Young people who died before marriage are sometimes believed to become more active pocong
- **Pregnancy**: Women who died during pregnancy or childbirth may exhibit maternal behaviors

## Behavior and Characteristics

### General Behavior Patterns

The pocong, unlike many malevolent spirits in Indonesian folklore, exhibits behavior characterized more by desperation and suffering than by malice:

- **Nocturnal Activity**: Most active during night hours, particularly between sunset and sunrise
- **Cemetery Haunting**: Frequently found near graveyards, particularly around their own burial site
- **Wandering**: Roams familiar locations from life—former homes, places of work, favorite spots
- **Boundary Respect**: Often appears at boundaries—gates, doorways, crossroads, cemetery edges
- **Seeking Contact**: May attempt to communicate with the living, seeking help for release

### Motivations

The primary drive of a pocong is not revenge or harm but liberation:

- **Seeking Release**: The fundamental goal is to have someone untie the shroud knots
- **Communication Attempts**: Trying to alert family members to their plight
- **Territorial Presence**: Marking and revisiting significant locations from life
- **Witnessing**: Sometimes appears to simply observe the living world it can no longer participate in
- **Warning**: Occasionally appears to warn of danger or death

### Interaction with Humans

When a pocong encounters humans, several scenarios may unfold:

- **Startling Appearance**: Suddenly appearing on roads, in doorways, or near windows
- **Silent Pleading**: Appearing before family members with an imploring expression
- **Blocking Paths**: Standing in the way, forcing recognition
- **Following**: Hopping after specific individuals, particularly family members
- **Dream Visitation**: Appearing in dreams to request the untying ritual
- **Audible Requests**: In some accounts, pocong can speak, asking directly for help

### Rare Aggressive Behavior

While generally not malevolent, pocong may exhibit frightening or aggressive behavior in certain circumstances:

- **Frustration**: After prolonged inability to communicate needs
- **Disturbed Rest**: When the grave is desecrated or disturbed
- **Wrongful Death**: Pocong of murder victims may seek justice
- **Protective Behavior**: Guarding locations or people important to them in life
- **Mischief**: Occasionally engaging in pranks or minor harassment to gain attention

### Temporal Patterns

Pocong appearances follow certain temporal patterns:

- **Peak Times**: Midnight (*tengah malam*), dawn (*subuh*), and dusk (*maghrib*)
- **Holy Days**: More active during Islamic holy periods or anniversary of death
- **Forty Days**: Most active as the 40-day period approaches and passes without ritual
- **Full Moon**: Increased activity during full moon nights
- **Rainy Season**: Some traditions associate pocong with rainy, stormy weather

## Islamic Funeral Traditions

### The Complete Burial Process

Understanding pocong requires understanding the Islamic funeral rites practiced in Indonesia:

#### 1. **Immediate Post-Death Procedures**
- **Positioning**: The body is laid with the head toward the qibla (direction of Mecca)
- **Announcement**: Death is announced to the community
- **Prompt Burial**: Burial must occur as soon as practically possible, ideally within 24 hours

#### 2. **Ritual Washing (Mandikan Mayat)**
- Performed by same-gender family members or designated community members
- Body washed an odd number of times (typically three or five)
- Specific prayers recited during washing
- Body dried and prepared for shrouding

#### 3. **Shrouding (Mengkafankan)**
- White cotton cloth (*kain kafan*) used—symbolizing purity and equality
- Men wrapped in three pieces of cloth
- Women wrapped in five pieces of cloth
- No stitching—cloth must be unsewn
- Three knots tied: above the head, at the chest, and at the feet
- Knots secure the shroud during transportation and burial

#### 4. **Funeral Prayer (Salat Janazah)**
- Communal prayer performed for the deceased
- No bowing or prostration—performed standing
- Requests forgiveness and mercy for the deceased

#### 5. **Burial (Pemakaman)**
- Body placed directly in the earth without coffin (preferred method)
- Lying on the right side
- Facing Mecca (qibla)
- Grave typically 1.5 meters deep
- Wooden planks may cover body before earth is replaced

- **Seven Days**: First commemoration (*tahlilan*)
- **Forty Days**: Major commemoration and traditionally the *lepas pocong* ceremony
- **100 Days, One Year**: Additional commemorations

### The Lepas Pocong Ritual

The central ritual for preventing pocong is the *lepas pocong* (untying the shroud):

#### Traditional Practice
- **Timing**: Performed on the 40th day after death (7th day in some regions)
- **Participants**: Family members, particularly those who performed the burial
- **Location**: At the gravesite
- **Process**: 
  - Gathering at the grave
  - Recitation of prayers (*doa*)
  - Symbolic or actual untying of the shroud knots
  - If exhuming is impractical, symbolic gestures above the grave suffice
  - Final prayers for the soul's peaceful transition

#### Symbolic Untying
In modern practice, physically opening the grave may not occur. Instead:
- Family stands at the graveside
- Prayers are recited (*surah al-Fatihah*, *surah Yasin*)
- Symbolic cutting gesture made in the air above the grave
- Declaration that the shroud has been released
- Food offerings or charity given in the name of the deceased

#### Purpose and Belief
The ritual serves multiple functions:
- **Spiritual Release**: Freeing the soul from earthly attachment
- **Closure**: Helping family accept the death and move forward
- **Community**: Reinforcing social bonds through shared ritual
- **Continuity**: Maintaining connection with tradition and ancestors

The enduring belief in pocong, even in increasingly modern and urban Indonesia, demonstrates the power of cultural traditions to adapt and remain relevant. Whether viewed as literal supernatural reality, psychological phenomenon, social control mechanism, or cultural metaphor, the pocong continues to play a meaningful role in Indonesian Muslim communities.

### Cultural Value

### Future Considerations

### Final Reflection

The pocong, the shrouded ghost hopping through Indonesian nights, serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of proper ritual, family duty, and respect for the dead. Whether feared, pitied, or simply acknowledged as part of cultural heritage, the pocong remains a significant presence in Indonesian consciousness—a distinctive contribution to world folklore and a testament to Indonesia's rich cultural synthesis.

In an age of globalization and homogenization, the pocong stands as a unique cultural artifact, immediately recognizable and distinctively Indonesian, embodying centuries of tradition while continuing to evolve with contemporary society. It reminds us that cultural beliefs are living, adaptive systems that serve important psychological, social, and spiritual functions for the communities that maintain them.
